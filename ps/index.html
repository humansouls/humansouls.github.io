<p>Here's a few photoshop tips related to making texture maps for 3d
images. While there are plenty of tutorials out there discussing how to
paint texture maps for games and film, this tutorial is not trying to
be
all encompassing, it's just a collection of tips that I've found people
didn't know about that have always been really helpful to me, hopefully
you find them helpful too.<br>

<b><font color="#ffffff"><font size="+1"></font></font></b><b><font color="#ffffff"><font size="+1">Using The Offset Filter To Make
Tileable Textures</font></font></b>
<p></p>
<p>This is a pretty standard trick that most people know, but I do a
slight variation that you may find useful.<br>
</p>
<p>Say you have
a texture fragment like this (This is a photo I took at Lake Mead)...<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/offset1.jpg" title="" alt="Offset1" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;"><br>
</p>
<p>And you want to use it to tile (repeat) over a large surface.<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/offset2.jpg" title="" alt="Offset2" style="width: 800px; height: 800px;"><br>
</p>
<p>This of course doesn't look even remotely natural because you can
see the seams (see the red arrows). So how to make the texture
tileable?
The first trick
under your belt should be the offset filter. Take your original image,
use the offset filter (make sure it's set to wrap around) and set it to
half the size of your image, in this case, my image is 400x400 pixels,
so set it to 200x200 pixels. You get this result.<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/offset3.jpg" title="" alt="Offset3" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;"><br>
</p>
<p>Now use the clone brush to clone parts of the rock overtop of the
seam. You get this result...<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/offset4.jpg" title="" alt="Offset4" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;"><br>
</p>
<p>Now it tiles nicely with no obvious seams...<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/offset5.jpg" title="" alt="Offset5" style="width: 800px; height: 800px;"><br>
</p>
<p>This is a pretty standard technique, but one trick I like to mention
is be careful which brush you use to do you cloning. If you use a brush
that's too hard or too soft, you'll still have problems at the seams.
For example,
here's this hard brush...<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/brush1.jpg" title="" alt="Brush1" style="width: 343px; height: 80px;"><br>
</p>
<p>being used to clone this image (the image has been enlarged so we
can see the details)...<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/brush2.jpg" title="" alt="Brush2" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"><br>
</p>
<p>Here's the result, notice how it's slightly better, but you can see
the hard edge of the brush...<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/brush3.jpg" title="" alt="Brush3" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"><br>
</p>
<p>So the answer is usually use a soft edged brush, but that can also
cause problems...<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/brush4.jpg" title="" alt="Brush4" style="width: 343px; height: 80px;"><br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/brush5.jpg" title="" alt="Brush5" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"><br>
</p>
<p>This is far better, but notice the details sort of fade into each
other in the seam area. So you get this big blurry mess in the middle.
This artifact is also be undesirable, so for
my work I use a chaotically shaped hard/soft brush, which isn't too
hard, isn't too soft, and is oddly shaped so that the eye can't pick up
on the brush strokes...<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/brush6.jpg" title="" alt="Brush6" style="width: 60px; height: 60px;"><br>
</p>
<p>Also adjust the brushes parameters with a large "Angle Jitter", that
way each brush stroke will have a different pattern (since the brush
will be rotated a random value as you clone), and maybe some size
jitter (although it's not necessary).<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/brush7.jpg" title="" alt="Brush7" style="width: 361px; height: 427px;"></p>
<p>This gives far more realistic results when you blend the seam away.</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/brush8.jpg" title="" alt="Brush8" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"><br>
</p>
<p>Here's the image at regular resolution, no blurry mess, no hard
edges...<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/brush9.jpg" title="" alt="Brush9" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;"><br>
</p>
<p><b><font color="#ffffff"><font size="+1">Cropping An Image That's
Off
The Canvas</font></font></b>
</p>
This happens to me a lot. Say you have an image that's 300x300 pixels...<br>
<br>
<img src="./index_files/crop1.jpg" title="" alt="Crop1" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"><br>
<br>
And you want to add a new layer of dirt to it, and your image is
500x500 pixels...<br>
<br>
<img src="./index_files/crop2.jpg" title="" alt="Crop2" style="width: 500px; height: 500px;"><br>
<br>
So a pretty standard thing to do is to drag the dirt layer onto your
original image, and set the dirt layer to multiply...<br>
<br>
<img src="./index_files/crop3.jpg" title="" alt="Crop3" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"><br>
<br>
But now lets say you decide to make this tileable. So you select your
dirt layer and use the offset filter to offset the image 150x150 pixels
(half the size of your 300x300 pixel image). Here's the result...<br>
<br>
<img src="./index_files/crop4.jpg" title="" alt="Crop4" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"><br>
<br>
Where's the seam? Well, the reason you can't see the seam is because
even though the canvas is 300x300 pixels, your dirt layer is actually a
500x500 pixel image. You're only seeing 300x300 pixels of it. So the
offset filter doesn't work the way you want it to. To make the dirt
layer tileable, you need to crop the layer such that it's now only
300x300 pixels. The way to do that is to do Select All on the image and
then hit crop. This now cuts out everything that's not on the canvas.
Now when you do your offset you'll see the results you expect, and then
can use the clone brush to remove the seam.<br>
<br>

<p><b><font color="#ffffff"><font size="+1">Using The High Pass Filter
To Make Tileable Textures<br>
</font></font></b></p>
<p>Say you have a texture fragment you want to make tileable, but it
has
some big areas of light or dark such as this...<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/highpass1.jpg" title="" alt="Highpass1" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;"><br>
</p>
<p>Notice how the lower left corner is really darker than the rest of
the image. If we try the offset trick, we get this...<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/highpass2.jpg" title="" alt="Highpass2" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;"><br>
</p>
<p>This is going to be really hard to use the clone brush on, because
the seam area is so different, one side is really dark and one side is
really bright.</p>
<p>This is where the high pass filter is useful. The high pass filter
lets you remove large changes is brightness without removing the small
changes in brightness. And that's what we're after here, we want the
large changes in brightness to go away (the dark left corner), but we
don't want to obliterate the small changes in brightness which are
the cracks in the rock.<br>
</p>
<p>The procedure is like this, take your first image, duplicate it as a
new layer. Then run the Filter -&gt; Other -&gt; High Pass on your
duplicated layer. Play with the Radius until you've gotten rid of the
dark corner, but still have the small rock cracks. For this example, I
used a value of 28.0. Smaller values will remove the smaller details,
whereas larger values only remove the large brightness changes.
Experiment to find the ideal value for your particular image.<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/highpass3.jpg" title="" alt="Highpass3" style="width: 322px; height: 337px;"><br>
</p>
<p>This is the result of the filter...<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/highpass4.jpg" title="" alt="Highpass 4" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;"><br>
</p>
<p>Now take that duplicated layer and set the mode to Luminosity...<br>
</p>
<p><img src="./index_files/highpass5.jpg" title="" alt="Highpass5" style="width: 212px; height: 170px;"><br>
</p>
<p>The reason to do this is because the high pass filter can change the
colors of your image pretty radically. For example, if you look at the
image
above, running the low pass filter on the background copy layer made
the rock much
yellower than the original rock. So you want to keep the color of your
original image, but use the brightness information of your high pass
filtered image, hence you set the layer to luminosity.<br>
</p>
<p>Now when you use offset on the result, it looks much better, and you
can continue following the offset procedure above to remove the seam
(Note: Before offseting, flatten your image, otherwise, you'll only
offset your top layer instead of the combination of both layers.)<br>
</p>

</p>
<p>For more information, here's a more in-depth article discussing the
technique...<br>
</p>

<p><b><font color="#ffffff"><font size="+1">Additive Mode<br>
</font></font></b></p>
One thing that appears to be missing in Photoshop layers is an additive
mode. The idea behind additive is that whatever color is in layer 1
will be added to the color in layer 2 to get your final color. So for
example, if you have a 25% grey color on layer 1, and a 50% grey color
on layer 2, then the final color will be 75% grey, because 25% + 50% =
75%. The is useful for bump maps, if say you're doing a lizard,
and you have the scales of the lizard, and then on top of the scales
you want a rough texture, you can take your scale bump map, and then
add to it the rough bump map to achieve your final bump map.<br>
<br>
Anyways, Photoshop does in fact have an additive mode, sortof, it's
called
"Linear Dodge".<br>
<br>
<img src="./index_files/linear_dodge.jpg" title="" alt="Linear Dodge" style="width: 212px; height: 171px;"><br>
<br>
Why is it called "Linear Dodge" instead of "Additive"? Well, because
it's only additive as long as you don't bring transparency into the
equation.<br>
<br>
Look at the following diagrams made in photoshop. <br>
<br>
<img src="./index_files/lineardodge.jpg" title="" alt="Linear Dodge" style="width: 1170px; height: 335px;"><br>
<br>
The first diagram is 2 layers, the first is 25% grey, the second is 12%
grey. The second is set to linear dodge. The color in the middle is 37%
grey, which is what you'd expect. The same with the second diagram
diagram. <br>
<br>
However, look what happens if you bring transparency into the equation.
A white circle that's 50% transparent returns a color of 50% grey. Then
you add that to a white circle with a transparency of 12% (which
returns a color of 12% grey), and you get 56% grey? It should equal
62%? Basically, if you use transparency on your layers (including the
antialiased edge around anything on your layer), these return values
that do not mathematically follow the additive rule. And that's why its
called "Linear Dodge" instead of "Additive". <br>
<br>
Adobe AfterFx on the other hand has a true additive mode, which does a
real mathematical add, even when dealing with transparency.<br>
<br>
So in practical terms, if you're not using transparency, "Linear Dodge"
is an "Additive" mode. If you are using transparency, you won't get a
mathematical add, but you'll get something close. So I can still
recommend using "Linear Dodge" if you want to add two colors together
in photoshop, just note you may not getting mathematically perfect
results. Thanks to Tuomo Kulomaa for helping me with the transparency
experiments above.
